    "Now we can start picking out some individual things. This is one that you can do. Don't over do it -- be careful. Be careful. Where do the clouds live in your world? Create the illusion.

    <li class="list-group-item">Sing along as you're doing this. Everybody should have a friend.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Don't let your trees get too symmetrical... too even. Do whatever feels right.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Devote a little time to working with it. Maybe this is the same cloud. Let's get crazy.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">This is your dirt, so you put it where you want it. Always start with the color in here and then work outward.</li>

    "I may have to go find my old mukluks and put 'em on! Keep it moving. Zooooom... you've gotta make the little noises or it doesn't work right. Just make little X's, and we'll put in a happy little sky. We spend so much of our lives looking, but never, never seeing."
