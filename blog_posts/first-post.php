<p>This is the first paragraph of a blog post, and it serves as the teaser that will be displayed on the main blog page. Only this portion of the post will be visible initially, giving readers a preview of the content. A "Read More" link will appear below, allowing visitors to expand the post and access the full text.</p>
<p>Once the "Read More" link is clicked, the full blog post will be displayed, revealing all additional content beyond the teaser. This allows for structured, readable posts without overwhelming the main blog feed. Additionally, PHP code can be included in blog posts, enabling dynamic content and enhanced functionality.</p>
